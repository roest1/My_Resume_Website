      <h2><u>About</u></h2>
      <p>I am a computer science student at Louisiana State University. I have a concentration in software engineering and a minor in math. I was born in Atlanta, Georgia, but 
        I've moved around a little. I grew up in the small town of Macomb, Illinois where I spent my high school days playing baseball and basketball. I picked up guitar in my sophomore year, and realized that music is just something I cannot go without.
        Going out of state for my college education has, and is currently expanding my horizons to things I would not be concerned with had I not gone to LSU. 
        I've always been confident in my ability to learn, and with the education I have attained so far, I am happy to say that I have found a few new interests.
        Starting with math, I am the type to prefer fact over opinion, and math is a useful and universal way to express the world with facts. My major being Computer Science requires me to study algorithms, 
        however the prerequisites of programming as forced me to learn how to code. My goals align well with my interests. Musically, I hope to become listenable enough to play on a stage.
        I hope to grow into a healthy old life, continuing my exercise and enjoyment of baseball and basketball. I intend to surpass the minor in math and extend that onto a masters degree, although I would like to begin work before that. 
        There are many facets of programming that intrigue me. Some of these include machine learning, algorithmic trading, automation, data science. I plan on learning and solving problems to the best of my ability for the rest of my life. 
        I ultimately enjoy working with those who share that mindset.
